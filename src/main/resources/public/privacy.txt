Tracking

We don’t directly track your presence on this website. Your IP address is logged and we look at the server logs on occasion, but this is in an aggregate fashion for the purpose of determining why people come to visit us. What we are most interested in specifically are two things: The websites that link to us and send traffic here, and what keywords people use to find us via search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and MSN.

Cookies

"Cookies" are data sent to your web browser from a web server (such as Google) that can uniquely identify your computer and store information about user preferences. Most web browsers will accept cookies by default, but they can be set to reject cookies, either from all websites or from specific sites. You can also manually delete cookies from your web browser. These options are generally set through a “Privacy” setting in your browser setup.

Depending on your location we can place a cookie that has a single purpose - to show us your location so that we can serve you the download from the closest server. The cookie is set to expire automatically after 48 hours and has no other hidden purpose (except for the download service) so we can claim that we use a single cookie without tracking or collecting data. We also run a number of scripts from providers such as Google. Some of these set web browser cookies. Google in particular quietly collects a tremendous amount of data on your browsing habits, and we participate in that data collection.

General information to all international visitors

We would like to inform you that we are now using Google interest-based advertising technology. This technology is implemented by "us" dfhu.org using Google. This will not be used to identify you or your location, it will be used only to help our advertising system ( AdSense ) provided by Google to show more relevant Ads to our visitors.

We also use the DoubleClick DART cookie from Google. What is the DoubleClick DART cookie?

"The DoubleClick DART cookie is used by Google in the ads served on publisher websites displaying AdSense for content ads. When users visit an AdSense publisher's website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser. The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help AdSense publishers better serve and manage the ads on their site(s) and across the web."

"Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.
Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet."

"We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. "

Besides Google AdSense we also use Google Analytics which may collect data. We can't say what kind of data is being collected, for more information look for their privacy policy or terms of agreement. Since most websites on the Internet run Google services, there is nothing to worry about.

This policy can change at any time and without notice.
